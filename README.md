# Speaker-Recognition
Speaker Recognition using MFCC features

•	In this Project we have develop a Voice-Based Biometric System and Demonstrate a machine-learning approach to identify people based on features such as Pitch and MFCC extracted from recorded speech. 

•	The features used to train the classifier are the pitch of the voiced segments of the speech and the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). This is a closed-set speaker identification.

•	The audio of the speaker under test is compared against all the available speaker models (a finite set) and the closest match is returned.

•	To Extract the feature MFCC we will be using different digital signal processing such as FFT and DCT.
